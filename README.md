## Contributing
#### Do not make changes to master branch and do not merge your branch in to master without at least 1 approving review

1. Create a new branch from master using this naming format: feature/issueNumber-title replace issuenumber with the issue number and title with a descriptive title
2. Make your changes and push to github
3. Make a new pull request to merge your branch in to master
4. Wait for at least 1 person to review the pull request then merge

If master has changes, while your branch is behind. Go to master branch, pull it, then merge it in to your branch that way your branch is up to date.
